\section{Clean Automata}

A state is $q$ \textbf{reachable} from $p$ if there is a computation from $p$ to $q$.
A state is \textbf{accessible} if it is reachable from the initial state.
A state is \textbf{post-accessible} if a final state can be reached from it.
A state is \textbf{useful} if it is accessible and post-accessible.

An automaton is \textbf{clean} if all the states are useful.
